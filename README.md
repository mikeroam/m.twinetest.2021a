# m.twinetest.2021a

Web-browse my sample twine story:
https://mikeroam.github.io/m.twinetest.2021a/
(Old link will expire summer 2022 is https://mroam.github.io/m.twinetest.2021a/)

Note: use twine's backup-icon because the browser's back-arrow is bad, will go ALL the way back, out of the story!

Note: this is the "main" branch of the repo, and the twine story itself is a file stored in the "gh-pages" branch of this git repo! (Quick link to that branch: https://github.com/mikeroam/m.twinetest.2021a/tree/gh-pages 
(old link https://github.com/mroam/m.twinetest.2021a/tree/gh-pages .)
