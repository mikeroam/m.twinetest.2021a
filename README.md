# m.twinetest.2021a

Web-browse my sample twine story: https://mroam.github.io/m.twinetest.2021a/

Note: use the twine backup-icon because the browser's back-arrow will go ALL the way back, out of the story!

Note: this is the "main" branch of the repo, and the twine story itself is a file stored in the "gh-pages" branch of this git repo!
